# liri-node-app

LIRI Bot is a command line Node app that takes in parameters and returns data. Through the use of APIs, users can search Spotify for songs, Bands In Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. These searches are made by using specific commands, depending on what the user would like to search for. LIRI Bot employs the use of NPM packages, including Moment, Request, and the Node-Spotify-API pacakge. The FS package is also used to take the text inside of the "random.txt" file and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
